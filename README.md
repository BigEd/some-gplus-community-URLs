# some-gplus-community-URLs

Find here lists of URLs of all posts in a few G+ Communities,
information which isn't easy to get. Each list is here in two forms: a
plain list, and a list of URLs in the Internet Archive's Wayback
Machine, which has a partial view of every post.

Here are the communities so far appearing in this repository, as links
into the very superficial copy held at the Wayback Machine. See the
files in the repository for the URLs of all posts.
